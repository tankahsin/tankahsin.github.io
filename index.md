_This section accounts for my career in the oil and gas industry._

**Sales and BD Professional** _(Jan 2015 - Apr 2020)_
- Since the oil price collapsed in 2014, I have found work in various companies which are related to Sales and Business Development due to my knowledge of the Offshore and Marine industry.
- However, the situation of the Covid 19 and the delay in FID (Final Investment decision) means that major projects are still very much on hold.
  - **_Sales Manager:_** @ [Rotating Offshore Solutions](https://ros.com.sg/)
    - From Jan 2018 to May 2020
    - ROS is a medium size fabricator located in Tuas. Their strength is modules fabrication for the FPSO industry.
    - My main role is to bring in the already thin works for the company. At the same, I registered the Company in Gebiz to tender for government contracts
    - I have successfully bided two jobs for the company, a US$1.5m electrical room module for Brunei LNG via Schneider Electric and from Keppel O&M, a S$8m contract for a Jackup rig modules fabrication.  
  - **_Sales Manager:_** @ [Asean Cableship](https://www.aseancableship.com/)
    - From Sep 2017 to April 2018
    - I was recruited to assist in tendering for a contract from my previous company Saipem.
    - The project called for a Cable Laying ship but Asean Cableship can only offer a cable laying barge. Therefore Saipem was unable to qualify the Company.
    - As the tender was unsuccessful, I did not continue after my 6 months probation.
  - **_Sales Manager:_** @ [Hilong Offshore Engineering](http://en.hilonggroup.com/index.php/app/win/cn/product_hygc/57)
    - From Jan 2015 to Feb 2016
    - This role was based in Shanghai for a newly startup company intending to penetrate the offshore installation market using a archaic anchor laying flat bottom barge HL-106.
    - My role was primarily technical transfer of my know-how to this company including bid and tendering procedure and strategy, presentation and clarifications meetings.
    - I left after my one year contract as I was unable to withstand the cold winter.

**Bid Management Professional** _(Jan 2018 - Dec 2014)_
- Bid Management starts from understanding the project requirements and submitting to the Company Management for approval to bid, so called the Bid/No Bid Decision with a short period of time usually 3 days.
- Thereafter, the proposal and costing will start and continue until submission.
- Once submitted, clarifications and re-submission until the tender is awarded.
  - **_Proposal Manager:_** @ [Saipems Singapore](https://www.saipem.com/en)
    - From June 2011 to Sep 2014
    - Proposal Manager for a few EPCI projects ranging from US$200m to US$1.2b

**Field Engineering** _(1994 - 2017)_
- I started my career with Heerema; doing project management and engineering in the office and attending field works such as site fabrication.
- Highlight of each project is the opportunity to attend offshore installation works seeing the whole project coming together.
  - **Project Engineer:_** @ [Heerema Singapore](https://hmc.heerema.com/)
    - I took part in many projects located in offshore Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and China.
    - From 1998 to 2001, I was re-located to Shanghai for a new built 520 foot barge that will transport a 12,000mT topside for the Shell Malampaya project. The topside was built by Sembawang.
    - In Shanghai, I was the owner rep for the detailed design in Shanghai and thereafter as a site rep for the construction.
