>_This section accounts for my career in the oil and gas industry._

**Sales and BD Professional** _(Jan 2015 - May 2020)_
- Since the oil price collapsed in 2014, I could still find work in various companies in Sales and Business Development due to my knowledge of the Offshore and Marine industry.
- However, Covid 19 further delay the FID (Final Investment Decision) which means that major O&G projects are still very much on hold.
  - **_Sales Manager:_** @ [Rotating Offshore Solutions](https://ros.com.sg/)
    - From Jan 2018 to May 2020
    - ROS is a medium size fabricator located in Tuas. Their strength is modules fabrication for the FPSO industry.
    - My main role wass to bring in the already thin works for the company. At the same, I registered the Company in Gebiz to tender for government contracts.
    - I successfully bided two jobs for the company, a US$1.5m electrical room module for Brunei LNG via Schneider Electric and from Keppel O&M, a S$8m contract for a Jackup rig modules fabrication.  
  - **_Sales Manager:_** @ [Asean Cableship](https://www.aseancableship.com/)
    - From Sep 2017 to April 2018
    - I was recruited to assist in tendering for a offshre cable laying contract from my previous company Saipem, now re-locate to Jakarta.
    - The project called for a Cable Laying Ship but Asean Cableship can only offer a Cable Laying Barge. Therefore Saipem was unable to pre-qualify the Company for this project.
    - As the tender was unsuccessful, I did not continue after my 6 months probation.
  - **_Sales Manager:_** @ [Hilong Offshore Engineering](http://en.hilonggroup.com/index.php/app/win/cn/product_hygc/57)
    - From Jan 2015 to Feb 2016
    - This role was based in Shanghai for a newly startup company intending to penetrate the offshore installation market using an anchor-laying flat bottom barge HL-106.
    - My role was clearly technical transfer of my know-how to the company including bid and tendering procedure and strategy, presentation and clarifications responses.
    - I left after my one year contract as I was unable to adapt to the living conditions in Shanghai.

**Bid Management Professional** _(Jan 2008 - Sep 2014)_
- Bid Management starts from understanding the project requirements and submitting to the Management for a Bid/No Bid Decision within a very short period of time (usually 3 days).
- Thereafter, the proposal and costing will start and continue until submission.
- Once submitted, clarifications and re-submission continue until the tender is awarded.
  - **_Proposal Manager:_** @ [Saipems Singapore](https://www.saipem.com/en)
    - From June 2011 to Sep 2014
    - Proposal Manager for a few EPCI projects ranging from US$200m to US$1.2b

  - **_Proposal Engineer:_** @ [Acergy Singapore](https://www.subsea7.com/en/index.html)
    - From Jan 2008 to May 2011
    - Proposal and Costing Engineer for a few EPCI projects ranging from dayrates to US$200m

**Field Engineering** _(1994 - 2017)_
- I started my career with Heerema directly after NUS; project management and engineering in the office and attending field works such as site fabrication and Factory Acceptance Test (FAT).
- Highlight of each project is the opportunity to attend offshore installation and seeing the whole project coming together.
  - **Project Engineer:** @ [Heerema Singapore](https://hmc.heerema.com/)
    - I took part in many projects located in offshore Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and China.
    - From 1998 to 2001, I was re-located to Shanghai for a new built 520 foot barge that would transport a 12,000mT topside for the Shell Malampaya project. The topside was built by Sembawang in their Admiralty Yard.
    - In Shanghai, I was the owner rep for the detailed design in Shanghai and thereafter as a site rep for the construction in Nangtong, Jiangsu Province.
